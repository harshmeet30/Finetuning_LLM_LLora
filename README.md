# Finetune Large Language Models with LoRA and Hugging Face

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to **finetune large language models (LLMs)** efficiently using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and the **Hugging Face ecosystem**.

## 🚀 Features
- Introduction to **parameter-efficient finetuning** with LoRA.
- Integration with **Hugging Face Transformers** and **PEFT** libraries.
- Step-by-step workflow for preparing data, training, and evaluating finetuned models.
- Examples for running on **GPU (CUDA)** environments.
- Easy to extend to different LLMs and datasets.

## ⚙️ Requirements
To run the notebook, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate peft
```

Optional (for training visualization & experiment tracking):
```bash
pip install wandb
```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FInetune_Large_Language_Models_with_LoRA_and_Hugging_Face.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps inside the notebook to:
   - Load a base model from Hugging Face Hub.
   - Apply LoRA for efficient finetuning.
   - Train on your custom dataset.
   - Evaluate and save the finetuned model.
